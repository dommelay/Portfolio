        <h1>Hi, I'm Dominique.<br>A Software Engineer.</h1>
        <p>I'm an aspiring software engineer with a background in neuroscience and a passion for full stack development. Currently based in New York City. Welcome to my portfolio, take a look around! </p>
    </div>
    <div id="about">
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>For the majority of my life, I've lived in the Metro Detroit area of Michigan. I recently graduated from the University of Michigan, where I was pre-med and obtained a Bachelor of Science in biopsychology, cognition, and neuroscience. By the time I had graduated, I had completely lost my desire to go to medical school. I decided to move to New York City to find my passion and pursue new endeavors.</p>
        <h2>Why Software Engineering</h2>
        <p>I had always been interested in tech and learning how to code, but for the longest time I was discouraged when it came to pursuing a career in this field because I had devoted my life to medicene. After deciding against going to medical school, I did some research about different jobs in tech and came across software engineering.<br><br>I am hard working, driven, and highly analytical. I am motivated by complexity and challenging work, and I am very curious and always eager to learn new things. I am very creative and enjoy building things from the ground up, and problem-solving has always been one of my strengths. I am extremely passionate about my work, continuously improving myself, and growing my capabilities. This is why software engineering is the perfect field for me. </p>
        <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
        <p>Outside of coding, the majority of my free time is spent exercising or modeling. I'm very inetersted in athletics, as I was a D1 rower for some time in univeristy. I really enjoy lifting weights, you can find me at the gym every day after work. I'm also very ineterested in fashion and I have been modeling since I moved to New York. I've walked the runway quite a few times, but I prefer photoshoots and editorial work.  </p>
